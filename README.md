A little Dragon called Parvus (latin for little) wants to become the greatest Wizard of all time, but right now he's only a young student and needs to train his skills. He's already the best of his class, but he still wants to improve.

Now he's looking for everything and needs our help. 

About the Game

Parvus' Potions is a treasure hunter game - the player has to collect different items by running around with the arrow-keys. The right ingredients are on the recipe, which are randomly generated and the player needs to remember what he collected already or the cauldron will explode if you put something wrong in it. When pressing 'i', you can see the inventory. To put the collected ingredients into the cauldron, the player has to press 'space'.

The game uses a charming child-like art style and theme to evoke a sense of wonder and fairy tales. 'Parvus' Potions' is supposed to provide a relaxing experience that can be enjoyed by everyone. The music gives it a magical feeling.
